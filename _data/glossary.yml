LTL: "Linear-time Temporal Logic."

CTL: "Computation Tree Logic."

stutter-invariant: "A stutter invariant property does not observe immediate successors, allowing simplifications in the model-checking algorithm (such as partial order reduction)."

partial-order reduction: "Approaches that fight combinatorial state-space explosion by exploiting commutativity of actions."
