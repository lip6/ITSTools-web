# Command-line wrapper to Eclipse

There are scenarios where clicking in Eclipse menus is not appropriate or desirable.
Since the command line libITS based tools accept a restricted GAL syntax and do not
offer all the features of the EMF based transformations, this project provides an easy to deploy command-line wrapper to eclipse based functionality.

This functionality is still work in progress.
